MorningGlory
============

MorningGlory is a rake task that manages the deployment of static assets to 
the Amazon Cloudfront CDN.

It solves a number of common issues with S3/Cloudfront. For instance, Cloudfront 
won't expire assets stored on edge nodes when you redeploy. MorningGlory will
automatically namespace asset releases for you, then update all references to 
those renamed assets within your stylesheets.


About the name

Perhaps not what you'd expect, a Morning Glory is a rare cloud formation observed by glider pilots in Australia.
