h1. MorningGlory

MorningGlory is a rake task that manages the deployment of static assets to 
the Amazon Cloudfront CDN.

It solves a number of common issues with S3/Cloudfront. For instance, Cloudfront 
won't expire assets stored on edge nodes when you redeploy. MorningGlory will
automatically namespace asset releases for you, then update all references to 
those renamed assets within your stylesheets.

h2. Configuration

h3. The MorningGlory configuration file, @config/morning_glory.yml@

h3. The Amazon S3 authentication keys configuration file, @config/s3.yml@


h3. Set up an asset_host

For each environment that you'd like to utilise the CloudFront CDN for you'll need to define the asset_host within the @config/environments/{ENVIRONMENT}.rb@ configuration file.
The AssetHostingWithMinimumSsl plugin is used to ensure that you're switching between HTTP and HTTPS as required.

h4. Example @config/environments/production.rb@:

<pre>
  config.action_controller.asset_host = AssetHostingWithMinimumSsl.new(w
    "http://cdn%d.app.yoursite.com",
    "https://www.yoursite.com"
  )
</pre>
