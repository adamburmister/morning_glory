h1. MorningGlory

h2. What does it do?
MorningGlory is a rake task that manages the deployment of static assets into an Amazon Cloudfront CDN's S3 Bucket.

It solves a number of common issues with S3/Cloudfront. For instance, Cloudfront won't expire assets stored on edge nodes when you redeploy. 
MorningGlory will automatically namespace asset releases for you, then update all references to those renamed assets within your stylesheets.

h2. What doesn't it do for you?
You will require an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account in order to use this gem. Specially you will need S3 for storing the files you wish to distrubute, and Cloudfront for CDN distribution of those files.
MorningGlory cannot configure your Cloudfront distributions for you automatically. You will manually have to login to your AWS Management Console account, https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home, and set up a distribution pointing to an S3 Bucket.

h2. Configuration

h3. The MorningGlory configuration file, @config/morning_glory.yml@

h3. The Amazon S3 authentication keys configuration file, @config/s3.yml@


h3. Set up an asset_host

For each environment that you'd like to utilise the CloudFront CDN for you'll need to define the asset_host within the @config/environments/{ENVIRONMENT}.rb@ configuration file.
The AssetHostingWithMinimumSsl plugin is used to ensure that you're switching between HTTP and HTTPS as required.

h4. Example @config/environments/production.rb@:

<pre>
  config.action_controller.asset_host = AssetHostingWithMinimumSsl.new(w
    "http://cdn%d.app.yoursite.com",
    "https://www.yoursite.com"
  )
</pre>
